# Intro-to-Web-Dev
An introductory workshop by the [UVic Web Development and Design club](https://github.com/uvicwebdev), prepared and presented by Juan Carlos Gallegos.

## Prerequisites
### Basics
* A text editor of your choosing (e.g. VS Code, Atom, etc.)
* A browser, preferably Chrome or Firefox
* A terminal/command prompt (e.g. Terminal or iTerm on Mac; Command Prompt or Powershell on Windows)

### Node
Node is a JavaScript Interpreter, which we need to run our server application.

Installation:
* On Mac [with homebrew](https://www.dyclassroom.com/howto-mac/how-to-install-nodejs-and-npm-on-mac-using-homebrew); otherwise, download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Verify installation by opening a command/terminal window and entering the command `node -v`
  * If it's installed, you'll see some version number e.g. `v10.11.0`; otherwise, it will complain that it does not recognize `node`
* We also need `npm`, but that comes with `node`

### Git
Git is a (Source Code) Version Control Tool, but you'll just use it to get the workshop resources/code. Otherwise, you could manually copy+paste the file contents (possible but tedious)

Installation:
* See [this guide](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03)
* Run the following command from a folder you can find later (e.g. Desktop):
  * `git clone https://github.com/jcgallegdup/Intro-to-Web-Dev.git`
* As describe for `node`, we can check the version to verify that it's installed: `git --version`
