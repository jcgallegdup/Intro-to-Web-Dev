An introductory workshop by the [UVic Web Development and Design club](https://github.com/uvicwebdev)

## Prerequisites
* install `node` (which comes with `npm`)
  * on Mac, it's easy [with homebrew](https://www.dyclassroom.com/howto-mac/how-to-install-nodejs-and-npm-on-mac-using-homebrew)
  * Otherwise, download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* a text editor of your choosing (e.g. VS Code, Atom, etc.)
* a browser, preferably Chrome or Firefox

### Nice-to-Have
* `git`
  * with `git clone`, you can download this entire repo onto your computer: `git clone https://github.com/jcgallegdup/Intro-to-Web-Dev.git`
  * otherwise, you could manually download the files

## Acknowledgements
